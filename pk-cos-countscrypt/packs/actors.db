Their humanoid bodies incorporate the features of various beasts. For example, one mongrelfolk might have the basic body shape of a dwarf with a head that combines the features of a cat and a lizard, one arm that ends in a crab&rsquo;s pincer, and one leg that ends in a cloven hoof. Another might have the skin and horns of a cow, the eyes of a spider, frog&rsquo;s legs, and a scaly lizard&rsquo;s tail. Each mongrelfolk&rsquo;s mad combination of humanoid and animal forms results in its having a slow, awkward gait.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sound Mimicry. Mongrelfolk have misshapen mouths and vocal cords. They speak fragmented Common mixed with various animal cries and nonsense. They can effectively imitate sounds made by beasts and humanoids that they&rsquo;ve heard. Mongrelfolk aren&rsquo;t sophisticated enough to use these sounds as a covert form of communication, but they can use the sounds to lure enemies into a trap or otherwise distract them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Outcasts. Mongrelfolk are seldom welcome in other humanoid societies, where they are abused, enslaved, or shunned. They typically live on the fringes of civilization in ruins, deserted buildings, or other places that other humanoid races once lived in or built. They tend to be timid and skittish outside their homes and fiercely territorial within their lairs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Camouflage Experts. Mongrelfolk often hide their deformities under cloaks and cowls. In this way, they can sometimes pass as stout humans or thin dwarves. They are fond of camouflage, attaching leaves and twigs to their cloaks, making brown paint to cover their skin, and weaving grass nets under which they can hide. They use such camouflage while hunting in the wild or while standing guard outside their lairs. Until it is seen, a camouflaged mongrelfolk has advantage on Stealth checks made to hide.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Horrific Offspring. It&rsquo;s possible to restore a mongrelfolk to its original form using a greater restoration spell, but the same can&rsquo;t be said for a mongrelfolk&rsquo;s offspring. Only mongrelfolk that are made by magic can be restored to their original forms. Mongrelfolk that are born are true mongrelfolk and not the subjects of a spell or an effect that can be undone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mongrelfolk can breed with other humanoids, but nearly all children born to such parents are mongrelfolk.

It can choose to end its undead existence at any time. Its spirit lingers willingly, either out of loyalty to its former master or because it believes it must perform a task to satisfy its honor or sense of duty. For example, a guard who dies defending a wall might return as a phantom warrior and continue guarding the wall, then disappear forever once a new guard assumes its post or the wall is destroyed. The period between the time it died and the time it rises as a phantom warrior is usually 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Faded Memories.</strong></em> A phantom warrior retains the alignment and personality it had before it died, and it remembers how it died.

The skeletal servant you have raised is little more than a brainless husk.&nbsp; Without proper, and I mean proper, instruction, the bones in front of you might as well have remained dusty upon the floor.&nbsp; Explain the orders carefully and lay out the steps of your new servant’s tasks with exceeding care.&nbsp; Also, should you catch your skeletal friend partaking in the activities of their former life, do not scold them.&nbsp; The mundane routine of chopping wood or swinging a hammer can allow for more malleable servants as time continues.<br><em>The Book of Dark Servants, Vol III.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Skeletons are beings raised into undeath by the will of necromantic magic.&nbsp; The necromantic magics used within the ritual can either be cast by a trained hand or simply seep into the bones of the skeleton in areas of concentrated death.&nbsp; Cemeteries, catacombs, and battle fields are all subject to the sporadic rising of skeletons into their new lives.&nbsp; The magic not only keeps the skeleton “living”, but it also binds joints and bones together like spectral ligaments.&nbsp; With its second life, the skeleton acts as a semi-mindless creature serving its master’s will.</p>\n<p><strong>Spooky Scary.</strong> For the up and coming necromancer, skeletons make worthy guards for a hidden repository of forbidden knowledge.&nbsp; Skeletons will follow simple to mildly complex orders given (such as forming a protective circle or constructing minor defenses) without the necromancer needing to worry about the durability of their creations.&nbsp; The skeletons will avoid danger and refuse to injure themselves unless explicitly ordered by their master.&nbsp; Skeletons do seem to grow rather bored without direction and have been observed ambling around an area performing simple actions from their past lives.&nbsp; One notable skeleton I recall was still able to cast their fishing line, though clumsily at best, into the nearby lake.&nbsp; Skeletons, however, are not utilized for their prior skills but as guardians of the necromancer who summoned them back from the hells.&nbsp; Skeletons are more than capable when swinging a sword or firing a crossbow, finding martial prowess in death that they may have lacked in life thanks to the dark power flowing through their marrow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Author’s Note: Not all skeletal adversaries in an adventurer’s journey will be humanoid.&nbsp;

Rats are able to compress their bodies in such a manner that they can fit through spaces as small as the gap in the bottom of your door.&nbsp; Able to swim and navigate in the dark, some rats have been observed climbing out of small plumbing pipes, having scampered through the length of the tunnel to make it inside a merchant’s abode.</p>\n<p><strong>Rats Off to You.</strong> While many may dismiss the rat as nothing more than a common pest, even those not utilized as magical familiars are highly intelligent little creatures.&nbsp;

Do be wise in your selection of companion, however, as some rats carry deadly diseases from insects that nestle in their short fur.&nbsp; Along with its sharp, clinging claws, the rat packs a powerful bite thanks to its elongated incisor teeth.&nbsp;

Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":null,"cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}},"token":{"actorId":"bMduvTOYpPdI9qrV"}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"importid":"7POUsHp8zthefFuE"},"img":"modules/pk-cos-countscrypt/assets/actors/willa.Avatar.webp","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Willa","displayName":20,"img":"modules/pk-cos-countscrypt/assets/actors/willa.Token.webp","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":30,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"qr60M1HiBLbtZd95","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[],"effects":[]}

In much the same way that an animated skeleton is returned from the dead so too are zombies shunted back into this world.&nbsp; While a skilled spellcaster may animate the dead and command the newly awakened, zombies may also rise in areas of the world saturated with necromantic energy.&nbsp; In this situation, the zombies will not obey the command of a master, but roam aimlessly in a small area until they either find something to attack and consume or rot away into a pile of inanimate bones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Re: Your Brains.</strong> Zombies do retain quite a lot of their former selves in regards to their physical appearance.&nbsp; Zombies will still show the wounds or disease scars which slew them upon reanimating.&nbsp; The symptoms of decay will also be present as many freshly spawned zombies will be bloated, have patches of skin sloughing from their bodies, or even trailing entrails from exploded abdomens.&nbsp; While a zombie may resemble the person they were before, there is nothing at work within the head except mindless hunger.&nbsp; Zombies stumble through their existence in a perpetual state of mindlessness only able to heed their master&rsquo;s orders.&nbsp; This fact of the zombie&rsquo;s mind makes them invaluable warriors for a necromancer in need.&nbsp; Zombies are direct and will shamble off towards their quarry without so much as a second thought to their own safety.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been noted that some zombies have walked through fires or pits of acid in order to reach their enemies.&nbsp; Once they reach their target, zombies will pummel and bite at their enemy until either they or the enemy fall in the tussle.&nbsp; Zombies may also wield weapons, though not cleverly; zombies will not be able to reclaim a weapon should they be disarmed as the lack of weapon will simply drive them to claw with their broken hands.&nbsp; The magic which binds the zombie to the mortal plane is tricky to the uninitiated as well, so please be warned young adventurers!&nbsp; Should you fell a zombie, be aware that the creature may not be fully dead for the second time; you should always be sure to wait and see if the beast attempts to rise once more before wandering deeper into the dungeon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral Evil","race":null,"type":"Undead","environment":"Urban","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 316","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"understands the languages it knew in life but can't speak"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.NAISFPoNNgUCsEyW"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/undead/Zombie.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Zombie","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/undead/Zombie.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"wQX0J2qTOYiEzUP0","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"Ed7XgnZu9qRs3qdn","name":"Slam","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\"><p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+3 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.
