Rumors spread of grave robbers and a monster wandering the grounds of the Count’s estate.</p>\n<p>The Count's secrets did not escape the watchful eye of his master, Lord Strahd, who saw the actions of the Count as treachery.</p>\n<p>Count Lugosi feared what Lord Strahd might do and called on his good friend Doctor John Seward1 from the village of Vallaki to hide and protect his family.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, his family never escaped the fate of Lord Strahd. The Count was turned, becoming a Vampire, and cursed to lurk in the darkness and serve his lord and master.</p>\n<p>The Manor is haunted by the ghosts of his family. The Count rarely visits the manor, which brings him great sorrow. Instead, the Count seeks refuge in the deadly crypts below the manor, falling deeper into darkness, while slowly going mad.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>note: Doctor John Seward is a fictional character from Bram Stoker’s Dracula.
